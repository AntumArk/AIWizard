So you want to use Daknet neural network? 
You are lucky! 
There are some quite good instructions how to set up (and even use) written on https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet. 
Go there and do some reading.                                                                               

I can’t really help with this yet, as I only did this setup 1-2 times.

Do you want to visit that website?
