Preparing the database is essential. If I tell you to give me some runite ore and a bottle of aggression potion, what would you do? Most likely shrug your shoulders because you have no clue what they are. But if I told you that it was from a certain game, you could answer me that you don’t play it or do not have those items. It shows that with some information from the past, you can give me some defined answer. Same goes for the neural networks as they are based on how human nerves work. If you show it enough of images with your required object in it and point where it is in a picture and where it is not, after some time it could give you a defined answer of a confidence of an object in a picture.
But I see you asking – where can I get those pictures? And to answer that – it depends on the objects and scenarios you will be using. There is a whole field of science of preparing databases. I am no pro at it. All I can tell is about our current example of using basketball games videos to extract images for our logo detection.
